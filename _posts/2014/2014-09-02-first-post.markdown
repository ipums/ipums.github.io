[You may also be interested in reading [About This Blog]({{site.url}}/info/), a newer version of this topic.]

We're thrilled to be launching our first-ever MPC IT blog, and we're glad you're here.  We want to use this blog to engage with the communities around us: the University of Minnesota campus IT community, the Twin Cities software development community, and the worldwide community of IT professionals doing the same kind of work that we do, particularly those working in support of the social sciences.

To that end, we hope to use this space to highlight the interesting and challenging projects that we're working on, share our thoughts on important developments in our industry, contribute our collective experience and knowledge back to the community at large, and engage in dialog with others with an eye towards continuous improvement.

Thanks for stopping by, and we hope to you are inspired to come back often to see what's new and exciting at MPC IT.
