<b>What's the coolest thing you've gotten to work on at the MPC?  </b>

Building the team. Team building is incredibly challenging, but ultimately incredibly fulfilling as well.

<b>If you were a programming language, what would it be? Why?</b>

Perl. It wasn't my first programming language, but it was the first language I truly loved.  It's messy but practical. It doesn't concern itself much with appearances - it just gets stuff done. It has chameleon-like ability to morph itself into the tool you need at that moment. This seems to me to be a pretty decent approach to life.

<b>When you're not wrangling data at the MPC, what other things keep you busy? </b>Mainly, my son - I'm pretty sure some sort of fusion reactor at his core is responsible for his ridiculous level of energy at all times. I also am getting more into biking (Minneapolis rubbing off on me, I guess) - I bought my first "real" bike last year and I've been trying to make the 11-mile commute to work as often as I can. I catch up with hockey late at night with the DVR.

<b>What was the last thing you presented on / wrote about?</b>

<a title="Scaffolding for a Growing Team" href="http://www.slideshare.net/FranFabrizio/scaffolding-for-a-growing-team-surge-2014" target="_blank">Scaffolding for a Growing Team: How to Introduce Structure Without Being Evil</a>, at Surge 2014.

<b>What new skill(s) are your currently trying to learn?  </b>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I try to dedicate time each week to keeping my technical skills sharp.  I've been playing with some APIs (Google, Evernote) and Apache Spark lately.
