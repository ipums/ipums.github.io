A big part of the fun of working at MPC IT is collaborating with <a title="Meet the Team" href="http://tech.popdata.org/meet-the-team/" target="_blank">all of the people here</a>! We've got a pretty diverse group of individuals, many of whom ended up here via some fairly non-traditional paths. We thought it would be neat to spotlight staff members in order to add some depth to their background and interests and give a more human perspective to the team behind our products.

To that end, we've just launched our Spotlight series. Every month we'll do a mini-interview (minterview? mininterview?) with a different staff member. The questions will be a mix of serious and silly, tech and non-tech.  To get things started, three intrepid staffers graciously agreed to be guinea pigs.
