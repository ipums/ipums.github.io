Home base for ISRDI IT is <a title="Willey Hall" href="http://www1.umn.edu/twincities/maps/WilleyH/" target="_blank">Willey Hall</a> on the West Bank of the Twin Cities campus of the University of Minnesota. With the Mississippi River and the sprawling East Bank campus just out our front door, and the light rail station, Cedar-Riverside neighborhood and downtown Minneapolis out the back, we're in a convenient, beautiful, and connected spot. 

### Our Office
We've worked hard to create a healthy and productive space, and you'll notice attention to details like ergonomic work areas and thoughtful tech in the conference rooms. In our post-COVID hybrid world, we're currently upgrading out offices to better support both in-person and collaboration. Campus also offers lots of options for hiding away when focus time is needed. Sometimes it's the little things that put a smile on our face, like taking a break on the comfy chairs in the lounge and watching the trains roll by, enjoying the Peace Coffee we brew in the kitchen, or wandering into a bounty of homegrown veggies that a co-worker has brought in to share.

### Our Community
Hang around our office long enough and you're bound to run into an interesting gathering. Maybe you want to satisfy your intellectual curiosity? Try our seminar series, with talks that highlight the impact of our work around the world. Hungry? Then our monthly summer BBQs, fall chili cookoff, or end-of-year party might be just the ticket. And while you're wandering through our space, be sure to check out the research posters and technical diagrams. We're fortunate to get to work with such a talented and smart group of folks, and the proof is hanging on our walls.
