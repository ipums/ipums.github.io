### Li Dai

Once upon a time, Li Dai was an auto trader at his hometown in China, then explored his entrepreneurship via a family business in high voltage electrical equipment industry. But none of these opportunities kept him from going back to what he really wants, a career path in IT.  A java developer position was his starting point, he then decided to pursue his masterâ€™s degree in Information Assurance and got exposed to the world of Containerization and DevOps. Shortly after, he joined ISRDI IT operations team and has been passionate in providing safe, reliable computing environment for our software developers and users.

Aside from work, he still likes to share his enthusiasm in motoring with his friends, enjoys listening to music from Hifiberry, loves road trips and national parks, as well as being a good father, husband and son in his family.

### Colin Davis
<a href="{{ site.urlimg }}/colin.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-422 size-thumbnail alignright" src="{{ site.urlimg }}/colin-150x150.jpg" alt="colin" width="150" height="150" /></a>Colin originally got interested in tech through game programming. He ended up working as a call center technician for Zeos/Micron in the mid 90s, during which he spoke to around eight thousand people, most of whom you could locate on an anger spectrum ranging from mildly put out to incoherent with rage. He left to begin a startup in the lead-up to the tech crash.

Colin started at MPC in 2001 as a "Junior Application Programmer" and now works a senior software developer. He's been responsible for data extraction for the MPC's end users (the "Extract Engine") for IPUMS and Terra Populus and NHGIS in its latest version. Also responsible for data conversion on all microdata products.

Currently he uses C++ 11, Java and Ruby professionally. For hobby projects Colin has also tinkered with Go, D, Scheme, Perl, and is interested in learning Rust and Clojure.

### Jimm Domingo
<a href="{{ site.urlimg }}/domingo.jpg"><img class=" size-full wp-image-707 alignright" src="{{ site.urlimg }}/domingo.jpg" alt="domingo" width="150" height="150" /></a>Jimm has been hacking since... well, since Hector was a pup.  At least, back when hacking didn't mean cracking.  Long before this fad of connecting a series of tubes into an interweb...

After working at a commercial database shop in California, Jimm moved into the ivory tower.  For the past couple decades, he's been developing research software at universities around the US (New Hampshire, Oregon, Wisconsin, New Mexico and Indiana).  And now in Minnesota after joining the MPC in 2015.

Here at MPC, Jimm toils away in the Data Production group, helping improve the tools and infrastructure that researchers use in their data workflows (when he's not writing about himself in the third person).

### Fran Fabrizio
<a href="{{ site.urlimg }}/Fabrizio_Headshot-e1420664595616.jpg"><img class=" size-thumbnail wp-image-432 alignright" src="{{ site.urlimg }}/Fabrizio_Headshot-e1420664595616-150x150.jpg" alt="Fabrizio_Headshot" width="150" height="150" /></a>Fran originally planned to become a garbage truck driver (coolest thing ever to this 4-year-old boy), but the gift of a PCjr when he was 8 sparked a hobby interest in programming, typing in BASIC programs from the back of Family Computing magazine. Years later, he would find himself in the right place (a science and tech high school) at the right time (the birth of the Web), which changed his life course completely and led him to a career in computer science and IT.

After several years in private industry he moved to higher education where he has been ever since, splitting time between software development, system administration and management.  In 2011 he moved to his wife's native Minnesota and joined the MPC, and has served as IT Director since 2012.

Outside of work, Fran is likely to be found making a horrible mess of the kitchen, cruising around on his bike, or hanging out watching cars and trucks with his son.

Data proved to be a second passion though, and he's been working in computing since the late 1990s on a wide variety of gadgets and gizmos: routers, satellite data, DSL hardware, streaming audio consumer electronics, phone and voicemail software, and now human population data.

Ben works closely with demographic researchers at ISRDI on a variety of its products, particularly with IPUMS microdata. He's a Linux enthusiast and loves working in open source languages, and lately that means lots and lots of Python.

Outside of his work at ISRDI, Ben is an avid cyclist, golfer, and birdwatcher. He is also the father to two lovely daughters. As of this writing, Ben has never been to outer space.
