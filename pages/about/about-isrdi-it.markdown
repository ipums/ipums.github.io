ISRDI IT is a team of [designers, developers and sysadmins](/meet-the-team/) who collectively build all of the systems required to produce and disseminate the many <a title="Data Products" href="/about/data-products/">IPUMS data products</a>. That includes everything from parallelized data transformation pipelines, metadata management systems, high-performance data extract builders, and of course the websites which deliver the data to our user community.

Just about all of those systems are built using open source tools. Apache Spark, Docker, Jenkins, Ruby on Rails, Python, MySQL, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, Apache Httpd, NGINX, Passenger, Ubuntu Linux and Ansible are some of the mainstays of our technology stack. We have production code written in Ruby, Python, Perl, C/C++, Java, Scala, SQL, PL/pgSQL and more.

Many of us have traditional CS backgrounds, but we also count biologists, physicists, civil and electrical engineers, artists, and thespians among our group. Outside of the office we bike, run, homebrew, photograph, raise chickens, make honey, play softball, cook, birdwatch, and collect vinyl.

We try hard to make ISRDI IT a <a title="Working @ ISRDI" href="/working-isrdi/">fun and rewarding place to work</a>. Whether it's a Friday code hunker, a summer BBQ or helping each other practice our conference presentations, we work in a spirit of collaboration and community while building systems that users around the world rely upon.
